# Name:        Methods for capturing the food environment of tracks in terms of
#               accessible (afforded) food outlets.   This includes identifying
#               fixed and flexible (food) events in a track, as well as calculating
#               space-time prisms over a network to capture affordance space.
# Purpose:       In order to assess the food environment from an affordance perspective
